# Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is a data visualization dashboard developed using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The objective is to create insightful visualizations from a provided JSON dataset. Various charting libraries, including D3.js, Chart.js, and others, can be utilized to present the data in an interactive and meaningful way.

## Overview

The project aims to create a data visualization dashboard that dynamically fetches data from a MongoDB database using Node.js API endpoints. The front end is built with React and includes interactive charts and filters.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies for the server and client:

bash
Copy code
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
Configure MongoDB connection in server/server.js.

Start the server and client:

bash
Copy code
cd server && npm start
cd ../client && npm start
The server runs on http://localhost:5000, and the client runs on http://localhost:3000.

Chart.js
D3.js (optional)
and others...
API Endpoints
/api/dashboard: Fetches data based on specified filters.
/api/filter-options: Provides filter options for the dashboard.
Charts and Visualizations
Charts are rendered using Chart.js library and D3.js for enhanced visualizations. The dashboard includes various charts such as bar charts, line charts, etc., to represent different aspects of the data.

Filtering Options
The dashboard allows users to filter data based on:

End Year
Topics
Sector
Region
PEST
Source
SWOT
Country
City
and more...
Running the Project
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.
